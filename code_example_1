# Read a file and determine the average response time per ticket for each hour of the day
# 1) Nested function get_data opens & reads file, converts and returns datetime tuples.
# 2) Create an empty list data_tuples and populate it with two columns getting rid of the comma delimiter.
# 3) Convert the string into a datetime object. Only keep the hour as the first element, and convert second into a float.
# 4) Create a dictionary hour has hours of the day as keys, and number of tickets for that hour and sum of response times for each ticket.
# 5) Return average response time for each hour of the days
